NOTE: When you open "output.txt" file, it tells you that this example creates
      8 Gridlets. Then sends one Gridlet from "Example4" entity to a grid
      resource entity, called "Resource_0" with id = 7.
      Id = 7 for "Resource_0" is automatically and uniquely assigned by SimJava.
      "Resource_0" entity modifies the status of the Gridlet into
      "Gridlet.SUCCESS". Therefore, the output is correct as expected with all
      the Gridlets have the same status.
