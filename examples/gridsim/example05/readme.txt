NOTE: When you open "output.txt" file, it tells you that this example creates
      8 Gridlets. Then sends one Gridlet from "Example5" entity to a random grid
      resource entity.
      The resource entity modifies the status of the Gridlet into
      "Gridlet.SUCCESS". Therefore, the output is correct as expected with all
      the Gridlets have the same status.
