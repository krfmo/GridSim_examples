 * This class implements a broker for the user. The broker receives
 * 3 jobs from the user, behaves as an auctioneer, creates 3
 * and different kinds of auctions, submits jobs after auction clears.
 * After the jobs are returned, the broker sends them back to the user
 * We used reverse auctions, that is, the job is allocated to the
 * resource provider who makes the lowest bid. To ensure that jobs
 * will be allocates, we set the reserve price high (from 10 to 100) and
 * bids low (from 0 to 10).
