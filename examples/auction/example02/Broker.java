 *              This example shows how to create user, resource, auctioneer
 *              and auction entities connected via a network topology,
 *              using link and router.

/**
 * This class implements a broker for the user. The broker receives
 * jobs from the user, behaves as an auctioneer, creates different
 * kinds of auctions, submits jobs after auction clears.
 * After the jobs are returned, the broker sends them back to the user
 * We used reverse auctions, that is, the job is allocated to the
 * resource provider who makes the lowest bid. To ensure that jobs
 * will be allocated, we set the reserve price high (from 10 to 90) and
 * bidders are willing to execute jobs for lower values (0 to 10).
